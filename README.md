## ./lib/readmefy.rb
Readmefy by pauly@clarkeology.com
only matches ruby comments right now on their own line, though originally I wanted this to match php comments...
Usage: sudo gem install readmefy
readmefy .

## ./test/test_readmefy.rb
Only testing that the main method returns true right now

Still a work in progress, README auto created by https://github.com/pauly/readmefy
